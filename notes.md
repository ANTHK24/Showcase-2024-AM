- talk about how we started from low-fidelity wireframes in figma (An industry-leading design tool for apps and websites)
- then we added more detail (images, fonts, color) as high-fidelity wireframes
- then transitioned over to high-fidelity prototypes which are functional apps that you can use 

- Once Figma prototypes were finalized, we then transfered over content into Visual Studio code with HTML 
- Added CSS the next week

- Next steps: 
    Add a functional shopping cart with JavaScript and polish the CSS design
